   To handle the processing of packets, we created functions to parse the raw 
packet buffers into the structs. We also made packet building functions that 
fill in the packet fields to construct a new raw packet. These functions made 
packet processing a lot simpler. 
   To verify checksums, we made functions to compute the checksum manually and 
compare them against the checksum in the headers. We implemented a verify 
checksum function for each packet type that contains a checksum header.
