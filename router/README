   To handle the processing of packets, we created functions to parse the raw 
packet buffers into the structs. We also made packet building functions that 
fill in the packet fields to construct a new raw packet. These functions made 
packet processing a lot simpler. 
   To verify checksums, we made functions to compute the checksum manually and 
compare them against the checksum in the headers. We implemented a verify 
checksum function for each packet type that contains a checksum header. 
   We decided to reuse handlepacket to deal with packets that have been queued 
up waiting for an ARP reply. In order to accomodate this, we do some postprocessing
on the packets in send_packet, where we decrease the TTL and recompute the checksums
if necessary.
   Note that we tested (among other things) the ping, traceroute, wget
test cases as shown on the website, and our router passes the 3 cases 
so if you run into any unexpected errors, please retry the test case.
